#This project is a system designed for a pediatric clinic. It includes a patient portal where users can view their electronic health records (EHR), update their basic information, and book new appointments. It also features a doctor portal that allows doctors to view patient electronic medical records (EMR), create new EMRs, and view their scheduled appointments.
